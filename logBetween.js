/* 
Define a function logBetween(lowNum, highNum) that will print every number from lowNum to highNum, inclusive. 
Inclusive means that the range includes lowNum and highNum.

Hint: this function only needs to print using console.log it does not need to return.
*/


function logBetween(lowNum, highNum) {
  let i = lowNum;
  while (i <= highNum) { // inclusive of highNum
    console.log(i);

  }
}

// Examples:
logBetween(-1, 2); // prints out:
// -1
// 0
// 1
// 2

logBetween(14, 6); // => prints nothing

logBetween(4, 6); // prints out:
// 4
// 5
// 6
