# My App Academy: JavaScript Fundamentals - Conditionals
In simple terms - control flow is the order in which instructions are executed within a program. One modifies control flow using control structures, expressions that alter the control flow based on given parameters. The control structures within JavaScript allow the program flow to change within a unit of code or a function.

## Learning Goals

* Write ```if```, ```else if```, ```if...else``` conditional statements.
* Know that conditional statements can have only one ```if``` and one ```else``` statement.
* Identify that conditional statements can be nested.

* Know how to write a while loop and a for loop.
* Know how to convert a for loop into a while loop.
* Know that index variables conventionally start at zero.
* Explain what an iteration is.

* Write arrays using correct syntax
* Identify that an array is an ordered list of values defined by using square brackets ([ ])
* Use .length to obtain a count of the numbers of elements that comprise an array
* Index an array to refer to a single value
* Concatenate multiple arrays together
* Add and remove items from an array

## A Quick Word on Syntax
Before we get started we'll quickly go over the terms we'll be using to represent syntax.

1. ```[ ]``` are square brackets
2. ```{ }``` are curly braces
3. ```( )``` are parentheses
