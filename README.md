# My App Academy: JavaScript Fundamentals - Conditionals
In simple terms - control flow is the order in which instructions are executed within a program. One modifies control flow using control structures, expressions that alter the control flow based on given parameters. The control structures within JavaScript allow the program flow to change within a unit of code or a function.
